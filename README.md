# libhping

Simple	Haskell bindings for [liboping](https://noping.cc/)

On non nix/nixos systems, this library requires liboping to be accessible 
via `/usr/lib` or `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` which you can install using whatever
package manager you want.

If you're a nix/nixos user, you already know what to do.
